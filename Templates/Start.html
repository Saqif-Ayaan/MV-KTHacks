            <h1>What is a tumor?</h1>
                <p>
                    A tumor is a growth of cells that diverges from regular cell division. <br> The tumor overides
                    cellular regulation due to a mutation of the gene from damaged cells. <br> While some tumors can be benign, many are 
                    either cancerous or evolve to become cancerous.

            <h1>How does a tumor form?</h1>
        
                <p>
                    Damaged genes are able to lead in inhibited regulation of cellular division. <br> As a result, many "imperfect" cells can begin to form,
                    mutating further and further as they rapidly divide. <br> Stress, smoking, sun exposure, unhealthy foods, and alcohol are all leading 
                    factors of cell damage and, as a result, contribute to someone's likelihood of developing the disease.

            <h1>Metastasis</h1>
                <p>
                    As cancer divides, it has the ability to spread to other organs; this process is frequently referred to as metastasis. <br>
                    The significance of metastasis is that, depending on the location of the cancer, it may impair a different bodily function. <br>
                    Furthermore, the location of the primary site—where cancer had originally developed—plays a role in determining what type of cancer is present. <br>
                    The type of cancer can then be used to determine proper treatment options, as well as, possible developments in the cancer and metastasis. <br>
                    <strong>With this, to completely treat and eliminate cancer, it is vital to track down this primary site, which is what our project seeks to accomplish.</strong>
